### **Background** ###

Hi, I'm Gayle Centino and I am a Junior at Appalachian State University! I am from Raleigh, NC and I am Filipino-American. I am an undergraduate student studying Mathematics with a Statistics concentration and a Minor in Computer Science. After I graduate, I hope to attend graduate school in order to obtain a Master's degree in either Data Analytics or Biostatistics. I love learning how to program in different languages and I find technology interesting and exciting to experiment with.



### **Extracurricular Activities, Leadership & Community Service** ###

I'm currently heavily involved in two organizations on campus. 

Primarily, I am a member of a sorority on my campus named Delta Zeta. In Delta Zeta, we participate in community service every semester and we do a lot of philanthropic work. Our philanthropy is Speech and Hearing and our goal is to donate funds to several organizations that provide care for those who are hard of hearing. A unique feature of our specific organization is that at the beginning and the end of each semester, we collectively contribute our own time to volunteer and assist the university's bookstore when students come to check out or return their rental textbooks. This is a huge opportunity for us to raise money to donate to our main philanthropy partnership, the Starkey Hearing Foundation.

Additionally, I serve as a leader for Delight, a college women's ministry. In this organization, I am able to learn how to be a better leader for others and apply the skills that I have developed over the years. This provides me the chance to guide my fellow peers and to develop an intimate, Christ-centered community that allows women to feel comfortable and safe from any issues and conflicts they may be facing.
